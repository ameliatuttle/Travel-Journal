# Overview

I have been using XCode for around a year and felt like it would be bennificial to my learning to delve deeper into what it has to offer. So far I have only used it for C, C++, and C# so I this gave me the oppertunity to see all of the amazing features it has to offer and learn Swift. The iPhone simulator was really cool to learn and mess around with.

This app lets a user add an itinerary item to a travel journal. The item can have a title, description, and an image. You can also delete an item that you have previously entered. If the user wants to add an image, an image selector page pops up and they select an image from their photo gallery on their phone.

My purpose for creating this app was to explore the world of app building. Up until this point I have only built websites and simple programs, so this is my first look into building mobile apps. I really like it and I want to keep doing it.

# Development Environment

For this application I used XCode and the XCode Simulator. XCode is the IDE from Apple to make and build IOS applications. There are a lot of cool built in features I didn't know about until know such as the XCode Simulator. When you run your code a window pops up that looks like an iPhone. It has the basic functionality of one and even has the basic apps like iMessage and the photo gallery on it. Because of these apps you can build yours to incorporate these others. In mine I did this with the image selector that accesses the photo gallery.

The programming language I used for this app is Swift. Swift is a language created by apple specifically for making IOS apps for iPhone, Mac, Apple TV, or Apple Watch. It has a fairly simple syntax and uses structures more than it uses classes. I used a UIKit that gave me access to the UIImagePickerController so I could access the photo gallery.

# Future Work

* I can always work on getting work done earlier 
* I want to document what didn't work as opposed to viewing them as failures
* I want to learn more about what XCode has to offer
